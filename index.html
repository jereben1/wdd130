Nigeria has distinctive regions, including deserts, plains, swamps, mountains, and steamy jungles. It has one of the largest river systems in the world, including the Niger Delta, the third largest delta on Earth. However, Nigeria's most diverse feature is its people. Hundreds of languages are spoken in the country, including Yoruba, Igbo, Fula, Hausa, Edo, Ibibio, Tiv, and English. Nigeria is represented with a coat of arm and a green and white colored flag, where the green symbolises agriculture and the white color symbolises peace.Nigeria coat of arm is a hereditary symbol which established the identiy and beauty of Nigeria; both her agro-beauty and cultural values. The red Eagle represent strenght, the white horses represent dignity, the the black shield represent fertile soil, the wavy "Y" shape across the shield symbolises the meeting of Niger and Benue rivers at Lokoja and the flower placed on the ground where the shield is standing represents the beauty of the country and its nation; “Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress” line beneath the shield is the Nigerian national motto.
